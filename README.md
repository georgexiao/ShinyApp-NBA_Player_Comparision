# ShinyApp-NBA_Player_Comparision

As a NBA and data lover, I created this Shiny application to do some basic basketball stats analysis. This is a app to compare two NBA players' statistics.  
In this app, you can:  

 - Compare *16* years of data: from season 01-02 to 15-16. 
 - Compare *7* stats: points, three points made, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks and turnovers. 
 - Compare in *2* ways: total or average
